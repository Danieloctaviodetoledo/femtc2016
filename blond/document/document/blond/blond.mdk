~ Abstract
The use of premixed flames in hot smoke tests present valuable advantages in comparison with
traditional methods. The definition and control of the necessary power, HHR, is a great challenge due to the lack of information
about the plumes originated by premixed flames. This work presents a method to model the plume and calculate the temperature within it.
The hot smoke testing system Izar makes use of the model presented along this paper

# Introduction     { #sec-intro }
In 2013 regarding the new needs of the fire safety mark in Switzerland, the swiss company  Basler & Hofmann decided to develop an innovative hot smoke testing system. 
The result is currently known with the commercial  name of Izar.
Izar is the a hot smoke testing system composed by a gas burner, a gas supply system, and the additional 
fog generators to visualize the smoke layer.
The main characteristic of the system is the use of premixed flames to produce as heat source. 
The main advantage is the reduction, almost elimination, of the flame radiation and the elimination of the residues, soot yield, originate in the common diffusion.
The use of premixed flames made of Izar an pure convective heat source capable of reproducing the equivalent 
convective part released by the common natural fires with diffusion flames. 
The system may produce till 1'20 MW convective heat equivalent to a natural fire of 1'80 MW. 
This project was included in a master thesis work within the international master in fire safety engineering.

# A brief description of the work context and targets of the system 

The testing system Izar works in buildings or tunnels in use or just before the commissioning. The system must guarantee that no damage in the premises will occur. The main advantages of using premixed flames regarding for example the avoidance of cleaning activities, but the main challenge is to avoid damages due to the temperatures of the plume.

During a smoke test the "most realistic" conditions must be created in order to proof the smoke management system under the "most realistic" conditions.
Therefore, the system must generate the highest temperatures and guarantee that no damage will occur during the test. 
The target of this work was to study the temperature field created by the system and guarantee that valuable conclusions can be drawn from the test
guaranteeing the safe developed of them. Additionally this work must be done before the system was ready for it use an no laboratory test was still at this point possible.

Different equations and models are available in the literature to calculate the plume temperatures for diffusion flames according to its geometry and flame configuration (jet flame, etc.). For the common hot smoke test based on pool fires there is a vast literature and experience which make it 
possible to adjust the size of the pools according to the building geometry but no model was found to calculate these parameters for plumes generated during the combustion process occurred in premixed flames.

The processes with premixed flames are used normally in closed environments such as 
industrial ovens, in which the combustion efficiency is the main factor instead of the plumes produced by this combustion process are not enough documented. 

The geometry of the burning chamber, a rectangle, made also impossible to consider these traditional model mainly based on experiments with circular fire sources.

Therefore a new frame work had to be developed to study the temperature field in the plume created by the premixed flames. The decision was to study the temperature field in the plume modeling the system with FDS. 

# Modeling the hot smoke testing system Izar with FDS

The approach of modeling the system with FDS was not so straightforward because the combustion models of these software are 
not capable of simulating a premix combustion. 

The solution to simulate premixed flames consists of modeling the combustion like a source of 
combustion products released at the stoichiometric combustion temperatures. 
Izar uses propane gas as source of energy. 
The physical properties of the combustible are well documented in the literature. 
The adiabatic flame temperature is one these and it is the main model parameter.
The combustion in Izar occurs under stoichiometric conditions achieving very high combustion efficiencies, 
an very high temperatures. 
Above the combustion region, the plume temperature can be calculated using the fluid mechanic equations available in FDS.

The plume generated during the combustion contents the combustion products generated during the combustion. 
In the diffusion flames the efficiency of the combustion process defines what is commonly called smoke.
However in a premixed combustion these combustion products are well known and do not change under different 
environment conditions. By a simple chemical balance its is easy to determine these combustion products and the amount of them:

~ Equation {#Propan-combustion; caption:"Propan chemical balance"}
C_{3}H_{8}+5 O_{2}+5\cdot3.76N_{2}=3CO_{2}+4H_{2}O+5\cdot3.76N_{2}

The molecular weight of these species is well known and making use of the propane heat of combustion, 46.35 kJ/g, it is straightforward to calculate the necessary kilograms of propane required to achieve a certain power.The chemical equation can be after adjusted to determinate the kg of products produced.

For example, in order to generate a power of 500 kW, 10.78 g/s are needed. Using the mass ratio available in the Table [#malecular-weight], the generated amount of products can be calculated:

~ Tablefigure {#Malecular-weight; caption:"Calculation example to determine the amount of product released from a 500 kW fire"}

|          |           |           |                    |

| CO~2~    | -              | 3.3       |       35.57         |
| H~2~O    | -              | 1.8       |            19.40    |
| N~2~     | -              | 13.16     |          141.86   |
|----------|----------------|-----------|--------------------|

These calculation guarantees that the proper mass is being introduced in the system, and the subsequents mass balance in the system will be based on the correct initial mass values.

These values must be in the FDS code introduced with the unit (kg/m&sdot;s). 
therefore the combustion area must be also considered. In the studied case the burning chamber is open and has a V-Shape; it is 122 cm long and 17 cm wide. The geometry plays also an important roll to define the size of mesh. The mesh must represent the combustion area as accurate as possible. The initial geometry is related with the moment balance in the system, because it defines the initial velocities in the system. 
After a sensitivity analysis a 6.5 cm mesh was chosen for this case. 

Another significant factor in the model is the temperature. The adiabatic combustion temperature from propane was chosen. Per definition the mixture fuel-air is predefined and known in a premixed combustion. Stoichiometric mixtures can be defined in order to achieve the highest flame temperatures. These temperatures are the adiabatic combustion temperatures.

The definition of the initial temperature by means of the adiabatic temperatures guarantees that the initial energy represents the correct energy system and the subsequent energy balance in the model are based on proper initial values.

# Model validation

Two validation process were carried out: the validation of the plume model and the validation of the model working within a geometry.

## Validation of the plume model

The temperatures of the plume with the system working at four different powers were recorded during a measuring campaign. The chosen values are representative of the system and cover the low power, 100 kW, the highest power, 1.200 kW; and two intermediate values 400 kW and 800 kW.
The temperatures were recorded following a similar grid like the one programmed in the simulations. 

In the simulations a measurement grid was implemented along the X and Y axis, with a measurement position each 20 cm and reproduced in the Z- direction each 19.5 cm equivalent to three cells. 
The validated FDS model for Izar eliminates also the uncertainties related with the fuel and it combustions.

~ Figure  {caption:"FDS Model with the temperature measurement grid"}
  ![FDS grid]

~

During the test not all the points could be controlled. Only the central position and two position along the X and Y axis were recorded. These positions were controlled at three different heights above the burner surface: 3 m, 4 m and 6 m. 

These measurements can be defined like local measurements with the aim of obtaining data to compare with simulations.
The following graphs show the comparison between the recorded temperatures in the simulations and the ones recorded during the full scale test and their comparison with the FDS model with the system working at 1.200 kW (maximum power).

## Validation of the model during full scale tests
Following the validation process the model was compared with the real data obtained from fuel scales tests with Izar in a big industrial hall.
The aim of this validation was to confirm that the FDS model of Izar is capable of reproducing the behavior of the system during a real smoke test, and consequently the created smoke layer.

The tests took place in a big industrial hall with an approximate area of 3.000 m^2^ and 9.5 m high. 
Different test with different powers were carried out and the temperatures within the smoke layer were recorded at 5 m, 10 m, and 20 m, from the burner position. A depth of 2.25 m under the ceiling was controlled. The interval between the temperature sensor can be found in the figure [#sensor-manegg]

The geometry was reproduced in FDS and Izar was modeled using the previous described. The temperature was recorded in the FDS model at the same positions as in the real test.
The figure [#temp-sensor-manegg] shows thee example with the comparison between both temperatures at different positions.

# Conclusion

The methodology presented along this paper is a efficient tool to model the plumes originated by the premixed combustion generated by the hot smoke testing system Izar in FDS. 

The main model input parameters are the combustion products, the adiabatic flame temperature and the combustion geometry. The method takes advantage of properties of the premixed combustion process, which allow easily to define the combustions products, that are released during the combustion process to define them.

The recorded temperatures during full scale test confirm the experimental results and allow the model validation. It is remarkable the agreement between the central plume temperatures. These temperatures are the result of the turbulence and entrainment process around plume perimeter. The agreement between the real temperatures and the recorded temperatures in the FDS model, confirm that the turbulence process are correctly solve in FDS and validate it.

The agreement between the temperatures from the industry hall, confirm that FDS is capable of representing the performance of the smoke testing system Izar.

Thanks to these model it is possible to model the hot smoke testing system Izar with FDS and defined the plume temperatures for different powers and different heights. These data have a direct application in the design of hot smoke tests systems with Izar.

The experiences during these smoke tests confirm that it is possible to define the exact power regarding the height of the room where the smoke test takes place considering the room limiting factors such as the presence of sprinklers, on the FDS plume models in FDS and the recorded temperatures. 

# Future work

It will be desirable to test the method under different geometries and with different fuels. The presented results are only based on the experiences with Izar. Different configurations must be investigated to confirm the exposed ideas.

If the necessary information is available, a equivalent equation to those available to calculate the plume temperatures from diffusions flames could be developed.
These information will be very valuable in order to extend the use of systems with premixed flames, for example hot smoke testing systems, in open spaces.

The available validated FDS model for Izar opens a wide range of possibilities regarding the validation of FDS geometries. 
The design fires exceeds the limits during the smoke tests. Untenable temperatures will be reached in the room causing damage in it. Real test can be carried out with Izar under controlled temperatures conditions and the necessary measures can be recorded. These measurements can be used to calibrate and validate the FDS geometry.
The last step is to program the design fires in this previously validated geometry which eliminates many model uncertainties. 

These kind of "a priori" validated simulations offer a greater grade of confidence and may reduce the safety factors taken in the design of the smoke management systems, optimizing the solutions.

# PRESENTATION
Each author must present his/her paper within the allotted time, allowing
for some minutes of open discussion. The session chair is responsible for
keeping authors within their time limit, in order to ensure that each
author has enough time for their presentation. When preparing your
presentation slides, make sure they are clear and large enough so that
your audience can read them from as far as 80 feet away.

All presentations will be made using the computer projector available in
the conference room. We will not have overhead projectors or slide
projectors in the meeting rooms.

Your presentation, in final form, must be received by **October 15th,
2016**. A final commit of the files to the GitHub repository is
preferred. Once the final draft is complete and reviewed it will be
merged into the master branch of the repository. If you decide to use
some other tool for creating your presentation, PDF format is preferred,
but ODP, PPT, or PPTX formats are acceptable. Please e-mail the files
to

All presentations will be pre-loaded on the computers that are present.
Please note that this approach will make it necessary for us to receive
the presentation files prior to the conference. If you have a different
software requirement, it should still be possible for you to attach your
own computer to the projector if you bring it with you. This is not
optimal, as it takes time and slows down the session.
