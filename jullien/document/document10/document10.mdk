~ Abstract
The use of egress simulation models in performance-based analysis relies on the confidence in the input and output data.
These data strongly depend on a large number of parameters. 
The undertaking study presented here focuses on the statistical aspects of these data, 
especially the population behavioural parameters which are the most likely to be scattered. 
The study proposes a method to analyse the statistical aspects of an egress simulation model. 
The method is based on statistical estimations of the distribution quantiles of the output parameters 
and can be applied to stochastic simulations results, in order to provide quantitative informations 
on the key parameters dispersion, such as RSET. It also gives a justification to the required number 
of simulations and input parameters precision to ensure a relevant output precision level. 
It gives access to quantitative criteria to compare experimental and numerical data. 
This method will be applied to analyse case studies simulated with BuildingExodus.

# INTRODUCTION { #sec-intro }

The practice of the egress engineering leans on digital modelings. Their purpose
is to determine the time put by last occupant to evacuate a building in accidental
situation or not. This time is called Required Safe Egress Time (RSET) during
the present document. The diverse phenomena bounded to the human behavior
occurring during an evacuation highlight they are not determinist. Indeed, the
intrinsic behavior of a person, for example its response time before putting in
movement, can be scattered from a situation to an other one.

Furthermore, from a point of view modelling, we do not know in a explicit way
the distribution of population and we create a panel which we consider
representative and envelope of the situation who can be scattered too. So, the fact that
the input data of the simulation are subjected to a statistical
spread implies a statistical spread on the out and particularly on the
RSET. But, what we wish at first sight of a egress simulation is
it supplies a RSET which insures compatible
tenability conditions with the evacuation and for 100 % of the cases. So, it seems
necessary to use a statistical approach to explore the field of possibilities
for the RSET and do an adequate number of simulation. The numerical tool is
suited to it and allows to determine a representative RSET in which we can
trust.

The numerical tool used within the framework of this document is BuildingExodus
v6.2. It allows by means of sophisticated sub-models to take into
account interactions type like occupant-occupant, occupant-fire and occupant-building.
So, it is possible to do egress simulations by taking into
account in a individual way the occupants. That is to say, that each occupant
is identifiable and has its own characteristics. This is essential to the study
presented here. BuildingExodus is also able to generate and process a large number of
simulations needed to conduct this study.

The statistical analysis method set up here requires some precautions.
First, it is essential to know the parameters (response time, walking speed, interactions
between people), which the dispersion may affect the desired results. The
knowledge of their quantitative statistical distribution is essential. However,
when we observe that exists in the literature, the results are not often presented
in form of statistical distribution. Usually there is a range with a minimum
value, a maximum value and a mean value. Thus, in this paper, we use only occupants
whose parameters are fixed or variable between two bounds and coming from
a uniform law to determine the influence of a particular parameter.

The statistical analysis method setting up is based on statistical estimation
of the output parameters quantile distribution (RSET in this document).
The aim of this method is to provide quantitative elements
in particular the statistical distribution of RSET and also validate the number
of simulations done for its determination. We will take an interest in particular in the confidence
interval for the 95th percentile. Thus, this paper presents the implementation off the statistical analysis method,
its application on simple test cases and results of its
application.

# STATISTICAL ANALYSIS METHOD : IMPLEMENTATION AND STATISTICAL ELEMENTS { #sec-statistical }

To introduce the statistical analysis method we consider a sample of n realizations
of a random variable that follows a normal law distribution. We draw a
sample of 60 achievements. In the following chapters, the variable considered
will be the RSET.

Then, we build a confidence interval I~p~ for each order quantile &alpha; from the sample of size
n = 60 by choosing a level of confidence p equal to 90%. The confidence interval
of quantile reflects the fact that the real value of the distribution function for
this quantile is in this interval associated with a confidence level of 90% here.
This confidence interval is expressed as:


~ Equation { #eq-alignment; caption:"Alignment example" }
\begin{aligned} 
 Ip  &= \bigg[\tilde{F}^{-1} \bigg( \alpha -c\sqrt{\frac{\alpha(1-\alpha)}{n}} \bigg) ; \tilde{F}^{-1} \bigg( \alpha +c\sqrt{\frac{\alpha(1-\alpha)}{n}} \bigg) \bigg]
\end{aligned}
~

with: 

* F the empirical distribution function,
* c the quantile ($1-\frac{p}{2}$) of the normal law distribution. c is equal to 1.645 for p = 90%.

The distribution function is said empirical as opposed to the real distribution
function. In fact, F is built on the achievements and is not the distribution function
whose equation is unknown in the case of the random variable is RSET.

Figure [#fig3_1] shows the random variable realizations ranked
in ascending order
constituting the empirical distribution function as well as lower and upper
bounds of each percentile confidence intervals.

This example highlights the problems related to extreme values of a random
variable.

On the one hand, a random variable can, not show a theoretical maximum. This is the case
of this simplistic example. It is also true in the general case of an egress engineering study,
where the random variable of interest is the RSET.

On the other hand, even in the case where the maximum value exists, the
finite size of the samples did not allow to access to this maximum value. Only are
available percentiles even greater than the sample size grows.

Furthermore, the width of the confidence interval decreases when the size of
the sample increases.

Consequently, during a stochastic study, the required number of draws is set
by:

* the desired precision, which requires a gap width of confidence,
* the order of the desired quantile, which imposes a number of prints.

# HYPOTHESIS OF THE MODEL { #sec-hypothesis }

The numerical tool used in this study is BuildingExodus. However, statistical processing
can be performed with any simulator.

We remember that BuildingExodus is based on a discretization of space in nodes
of 50 cm x 50 cm interconnected. The connection model is the one of Moore as shown on figure [#fig4_1].

~ Figure { #fig4_1; caption:"Nodes connectivity under BuildingExodus";  page-align:forcehere}
![fig4_1]

[fig4_1]: images/fig4_1.PNG "fig4_1" { width:auto; max-width:20% }

The test case is a room, square with sides of 16 m and 4 exits distributed on
each side (figure [#fig4_2]). An occupant occupies an area of 0.25 m² (0.5 m x 0.5 m)
or a node. Two occupants can not coexist on the same node. The exits measure 3 m of width,
and their flow rate is 2.0 occupant/m/s.

![fig4_2]

[fig4_2]: images/fig4_2.PNG "fig4_2" { width:auto; max-width:90% }


Concerning population, some attributes are arbitrarily fixed and others are variable
depending on test cases:

* occupants are all men,
* occupants have identical leaderships (in this case 10). This parameter affects how conflicts are resolved
when two occupants want to occupy the same node which is impossible.
BuildingExodus applies by default to the occupants a conflict resolution time of 0.8
s and 1.5 s before one of them occupies the node point of contention. According
to the test cases, conflict resolution time can be set at the average value of the
interval, that is to say 1.15 s.
* occupant's patience is fixed to 10 s. This implies that the occupants
are willing to remain static in a queue for 10 seconds before attempting
to change direction.
* occupants are all valid,
* their speed is 1.2 m/s,
* the response time is set at 15 s or variable between 0 and 30 s depending on the
test case. The response time in this study is the delay for
the occupants begin to move toward the exit.
* occupants act independently of each other, that is to say that if an occupant begins
to move toward the exit it will not make another occupant in movement before its response time is elapsed.

This document do not present the attributes specifically related to fire such as incapacitating
concentrations of toxic gases (HCl, HBr, HF, SO~2~, NO~2~, CH~2~CHO,…) because
they have no influence on the cases treated.

Regarding the choice of varying parameter values between two bounds,
it is carried out with a draw on a uniform law in the context of this study.

The most advanced behavioral options are left at their default values (e.g:
occupants are aware of all exits). The objective of the occupants is to reach
the nearest exit from their initial position.

Finally, when several simulations in large numbers for the same
test cases are performed, they are not used again from one case to another. That is to say that if
100 and 1,000 achievements are performed, the first 100 are not part of the following
1,000. The draw is completely redone every time.

# STUDY { #sec-study }

## Use of the statistical analysis method

In this reference test case we draw 100 times then 1,000 times between 1 and
1,000 people that were randomly positioned in the room. Figures [#fig5_1] and [#fig5_2]
show the distribution functions as well as the lower and upper bounds
of the confidence intervals for 100 draws, respectively 1,000 draws. The selected
level of confidence is 90% (we keep this level of confidence in the rest of the
document).

~ Figure { #fig5_1; caption:"Distribution function for 100 draws and lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval (reference test case)";  page-align:forcehere}
![fig5_1]
~
[fig5_1]: images/fig5_1.PNG "fig5_1" { width:auto; max-width:90% }

~ Figure { #fig5_2; caption:"Distribution function for 1,000 draws and lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval (reference test case)";  page-align:forcehere}
![fig5_2]
~
[fig5_2]: images/fig5_2.PNG "fig5_2" { width:auto; max-width:90% }

Note that the number of draws is too low to reach the theoretical minimum
RSET corresponding to a single occupant positioned in front of an exit. Indeed,
we could expect a RSET close to 15 s in this case (RSET = response time + travel
time).

In accordance with what has been announced above, it is observed that:
* the confidence interval decreases with increase of the draw number from 8.1 s on average for
100 draws to 2.5s on average for 1,000 draws,
* Extreme percentiles have a confidence
interval of which one bound is infinite for 100 and 1,000 draws.

Thus, it is not possible to statistically determine a RSET implying that
all occupants have evacuated in 100% of cases. This equals to the impossibility
to obtain a max RSET. In addition, in the case where we determine a RSET
max, we might question the relevance of such a value that would be drawn from a
disaster scenario and so wold be very severe in a more realistic study case. It seems preferable
to retain the associated RSET 95th percentile value of which we can estimate an
relevant confidence interval with a limited number of draws. table [#table-1] shows
the confidence intervals associated with the 95th percentile for 100, 200, 500,
1,000 and 5,000 draws. This choice implies that in 95% of cases all occupants have
evacuated with a probability of 90%. It is also arbitrary. Indeed, it is quite
possible to select another percentile associated with another level of confidence 
according to the desired accuracy on the RSET.

Figure [#fig5_3] shows the width of the confidence interval of the 95th percentile
according to the number of simulation. There are a number of simulations for
which the width of the confidence interval is sufficiently low to be acceptable.
Moreover, beyond this number an increase of the number of simulation does not provide
significant accuracy (see table [#table-2]) while it increases the computing time
considerably. Indeed, the simulations are all performed in very short times,
despite the fact that the population can vary from 1 to 1,000 occupants. So we
deduce that the time spent to perform the simulations is proportional
to the number of simulations (simulations are achieved in a sequentially way). So for all
these reasons, 1,000 simulations seem to be sufficient in the case studied here.

In conclusion, the application of statistical analysis method evaluates quantitatively
the number of simulations that seems most relevant to carry out a study.

## Complementary analysis

It is observed that at least three separate evacuation schemes exist according to the
number of occupants (see figures [#fig5_1] and [#fig5_2]) the table [#table-3] gives the
correspondence with the RSET obtained. These three schemes correspond to three
density ranges of people highlighting the influence of this one on the RSET.
Indeed, the density of people influences on congestion time and average speed of
the occupants which has a direct influence on the RSET.

The figures [#fig5_4] and [#fig5_5] show the dispersion of the number of occupants
according to RSET for 100 and 1,000 simulations. A greater dispersion is
observed for the scheme n°1. This implies that for this scheme, it is not the
number of occupant who controls the RSET but the distance from the last occupant
of the exist. This shows the interest of the approach developed in this
document, which provides additional elements of understanding of evacuation
behavior.

Applying the method to the reference test case shows that there is very little
simulations with the same number of occupant. This implies that we can not
quantify the influence of position and conflict resolution time on the RSET at
this stage of the study. This is the topic of the next chapter.

# ANALYSIS OF THE PARAMETERS' STATISTICAL INFLUENCE { #sec-analysis }

In this part, we look at the influence of certain parameters on the results of the
reference test case for the three schemes previously identified and at the quantification
of this impact using the statistical analysis method. Table [#table-4] shows the
characteristics of each test case.

In each case there is provided 3 sets of simulations. Each of these series take
into account a fixed number of people, corresponding to the median RSET of each

## Test case n°1
We run 1,000 times each of these 3 selected simulations by keeping
the same initial positions and the same occupants. Figure [#fig6_1], 
[#fig6_2] and [#fig6_3] present the distribution functions as
well as the lower and upper bounds of the confidence intervals. We observe that
the empirical distribution functions are not linear. Yet, the only
source of dispersal is bounded to the conflict resolution time and to the effect of history. 
It involves that the variability
of the conflict resolution time and the effects of histories
have an influence on the RSET.

In a synthetic way the table [#table-6] presents for three simulations:

* the confidence interval of the 95th percentile called I~p95%~ afterward,
* the width of this one called L~Ip95%~ (see figure [#fig6_4]),
* the interval between the lower bound of the 5th percentile and the upper bound of the 95th percentile called I~p5-95%~,
* the width of this one called L~yIp5-95%~ (see figure [#fig6_4]),
* the ratio between the interval described above and the 50th percentile called L~Ip5-95%~/q~50%~.

These notations are used during the document.

We observe that there is a certain variability of the RSET even when the
starting positions of the occupants are fixed. This variability is due to the variability
of the conflict resolution time as well as to the effect
of history produced by the various collisions. It is coherent with the fact
that L~Ip95%~ is higher for the scheme including a bigger density of people. We
also observe the same phenomenon for the width of I~p5-95%~. We call back
that the choice of the 95th percentile and by extension the one of the 5th percentile
depends on objectives of studies.

## Test case n°2

For this second test case the conflict resolution time is fixed to the average value of the
interval so 1.15 s in order to differentiate the effect of the conflict resolution time variability
of the history effect. We run again 1,000 times each of the three simulations.

In this case too, the distribution functions are not linear despite the fact that
conflict resolution time is fixed to 1.15 s. We deduce that history effects
are nonlinear witch is consistent with what we might suppose. In addition, this implies that the
distribution functions of test case 3 and 4 will not be linear. Synthetically table
[#table-7] presents I~p95%~, L~Ip95%~, I~p5%-95%~, L~Ip5-95%~ and L~Ip5%-95%~/q~50%~ for
the three simulations and compared to those of the test case n°1. The widths of
intervals are included in figure [#fig6_5]. We deduce that the fix of conflict resolution
time changes only little results. Thus, the vast majority of the variability comes
from the history effect and not from the value of conflict resolution time which seems
logical given the low variability of this one.

## Test case n°3
For this third test case we take again the values by default of the software
for the conflict resolution time and we draw randomly
the position of the people. We make 1,000 times each of these 3 simulations.

In a synthetic way the table [#table-8] presents I~p95%~, L~Ip95%~, I~p5%-95%~, L~Ip5-95%~ and L~Ip5%-95%~/q~50%~
for three simulations and compares them
to those of the test case n°1. The widths of interval are included
in figure [#fig6_6]. We deduct from it that the position has more influence on
the low and the average densities of population than on a strong density
what is in accordance with what we could wait.

## Test case n°4
In this fourth and final test case response time varies between 0 and 30 s for
the occupants (draw according to a uniform law). We retain the default value for conflict
resolution time and vary the position of the people. We run 1,000 times
each of these three simulations.

Synthetically table [#table-9] shows I~p95%~, L~Ip95%~, I~p5%-95%~, L~Ip5-95%~ and L~Ip5%-95%~/q~50%~
for the three simulations and compared to those of the test case
n°3. The widths of intervals are included in figure [#fig6_7]. We conclude that the
variability in response time affects the RSET which is logical. It is also observed
that the RSET min increases for scheme n°1 when the variability is added to the
response time. It is possible that on the 1,000 achievements few extreme cases
were drawn.

# SYNTHESIS { #sec-synthesis }
The application of this statistical analysis method based on the quantile distribution has allowed:

* to assess the number of simulations to perform to get a
confidence interval width in line with the desired accuracy or 1,000 simulations
in this document,
* to better understand the phenomena occurring during
an evacuation such as the existence of different evacuation schemes during this
study,
* to show the nonlinear nature of the effects of the input parameters on the
RSET which are in this case: conflict resolution time, the position of occupants,
their number and response time,
* to estimate the influence on the RSET of the
dispersion of the previously parameters mentioned above in a quantitative way for the test cases
shown in this study and particularly in using I~p95%~ and I~p5%-95%~.

This last point is particularly important. It allows to do more reliable studies
thereafter and informs on which parameters should concentrate research efforts
including the test campaigns.

Table [#table-10] summarizes in a quantitative way the influences of different parameters tested.

Of course, the results obtained in this study are preliminary results with vocation of illustration.
They need to be extended to more complex geometries and most important parameters dispersions
and non uniforms.

# CONCLUSION { #sec-conclusion }

In this document, we presented the statistical analysis method used and its application
to several test cases. The aim was firstly to interpret the influence of
variability of an input parameter to an output parameter: the RSET and secondly
to quantify the number of simulations required to make to have a short confidence interval.
This objective is reached on the test cases presented.
Moreover, we have also obtained information allowing on one hand to highlight some
physical phenomena as the existence of different evacuation schemes depending on
the density of people and on the other hand to claim that the distribution functions are
not linear despite the fact that the input parameters are drawn to a uniform
law or fixed. Finally, despite the fact it is impossible to statistically determine a
max RSET the method can provide a representative RSET linked to a confidence
interval.

There is a real interest in using this method, but there is still work because
this method is still in development and more complex geometries
and cross interactions between parameters will need to be study. Regarding the cross interactions, it
may be interesting to implement experimental designs. Indeed, the test cases
in this study have consisted in the study of the influence of few variable parameters
simultaneously. But, the reality has a part of variability more significant and it is
still difficult to grasp. This type of approach shows interests for future
readjustments on evacuation trials.

The need for a bibliography work and evacuation test was also highlighted,
in order to obtain reliable quantitative data on the input parameters of the
evacuation simulations. Finally, it would be interesting to industrialize the use
of this analysis method, relying on tools dedicated to stochastic analysis. Comparisons
between simulation tools also allow to precisely identify the behavioral
phenomena occurring during an evacuation, separating the internal
models influence of each other.
