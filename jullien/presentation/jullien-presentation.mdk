# Context {#vertical}
The use of egress simulation models in performance-based analysis relies on the confidence in the input data and the output data.

* But data strongly depend on a large number of parameters.
* So the results are prone to be scattered.

## Aim of the study
Propose a method to analyse the statistical aspects of an egress simulation model.

* The method is based on statistical estimations of the distribution quantiles of the output parameters.
The key result is Required Safe Egress Time (RSET).

Benefits of the method :

* Provide quantitative informations on the RSET.
* Justify the number of simulations to obtain a relevant output precision level.

# Presentation of the method of statistical analysis {#vertical}

Example : 

* Take a sample of n realizations of a random variable that follows a normal law distribution.
* Build a confidence interval Ip for each order quantile &alpha;.
* Choose a level of confidence p: here 90%.

~ Equation { #eq-alignment; caption:"Alignment example" }
\begin{aligned} 
 Ip  &= \bigg[\tilde{F}^{-1} \bigg( \alpha -c\sqrt{\frac{\alpha(1-\alpha)}{n}} \bigg) ; \tilde{F}^{-1} \bigg( \alpha +c\sqrt{\frac{\alpha(1-\alpha)}{n}} \bigg) \bigg]
\end{aligned}
~

c equals to 16.45 for p=90%.

## Build the empirical distribution function
Random realizations ranked in ascending order constitute the 
empirical distribution function.

## Observations

~ Align-Left
* A random variable can not show a theorical maximum.
* Even if the maximum value exists, the finite size of 
the samples didn't allow to access to this maximum value.

&rarr; Only percentiles are available.

* Percentiles increase with the growth of the sample size.
* Confidence interval decreases with the growth of the sample size.

&rarr; So, the required number of draws is set by:

* the desired precision,
* the order of the desired quantile.

# Hypothesis of the model

The numerical tool used in this study is BuildingExodus.

But, statistical processing can be performed with any simulator.

~ Begin Columns
~ Column { width:60% ; vertical-align:top}
Reminder :

* BuildingExodus is based on a discretization of space in node of 50 cm x 50 cm.
* The connection model is the one of Moore.

## Behavioral hypothesis

~ Align-Left
Occupants:

* are men,
* have same leaderships,
* have same patience,
* are valid,
* have a speed of 1.2 m/s
* have a response time (RT) of 15 s or variable between 0 and 30 s,
* act independently of each other.

The identical leaderships imply a conflict resolution time include between 0.8 s and 1.5 s.
 During this study the fixed value of 1.15 s will be use too.

The draws are achieved with an uniform law.

# Reference study case

Occupants are randomly positioned in the room and drawn between 1 and 1,000.

100 draws

## Obervations

It is impossible to determine statistically a RSET maximum.
~ Align-Left
* Extreme percentile have a confidence interval with infinite bounds.
~

In any case, a RSET max is bound to a catastrophic scenario.

&rarr; It seems preferable to retain the associated RSET 95th percentile.

~ Align-Left
* The value of 95th percentile is arbitrary.
~

## Observations (2)
The confidence interval decreases with the increase of the number of draws.
