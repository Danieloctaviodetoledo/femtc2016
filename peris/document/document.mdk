[TITLE]

~ Abstract
The structural response of bridges against fire is an under researched topic not covered in current design codes
in spite of its frequency and consequences. This paper uses Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations to study the
parameters influencing the temperatures in the gas surrounding I girder bridges during a fire, since this is a
critical parameter governing the response of the bridge. For the most critical case a methodology that uses
numerical models to analyze the damage caused by fires is shown.

# INTRODUCTION { #sec-intro }
The structural response of bridges against fire is an under researched topic not covered in current design codes
in spite of its frequency and consequences as it is shown in Peris-Sayol et Al (2016). In this paper, 154 bridge
fires have been collected between 1997 to 2015. The bridge damage level has been characterized and the main factors
involved in bridge fire damage have been studied. This analysis shows he main conclusions are that the only scenarios likely to
cause damage to concrete and steel bridges are a tanker fire close to the structure and a high calorific storage 
fire under the bridge.

# METHODS { #sec-intro }
## Parameters Studied
This study considers six parameters: four of them describe the geometry of the bridge (vertical clearance, bridge substructure configuration,
span length and bridge width) and two of them (position of the fire load and type of fuel) are related to the fire scenario.
Other parameters such as the soot yield or the position of bridge transverse diaphragms have not been included in this study.
