# femtc2016
Repository for FEMTC papers, presentations and related materials.

# Welcome
Thank you for your participation in the Fire and Evacuation Modeling Technical Conference (FEMTC), November 16-18, 2016.
This readme should fill you in on everything you need to know about your role in the event.  If I left anything out, or you have any questions please let me know.

# Event Website
We are using the Dryfta system to manage event content this time.

Event Site: https://femtc2016.dryfta.com/en/

You should already have an account on the site that was created for your abstract submission.  Please login to the site and update your account profile to include a profile image.  The image should be square so that it is not distorted when shown on the site.

After you have updated your profile, please make your profile public.

We will be changing your role in the system to 'Speaker' and your image and profile page link will be shown on the homepage of the website after we have everyone finally confirmed for attendance.
There will be more information to come about features of the Dryfta system as the event draws near.

#Paper and Presentation Details
We are using a new system this time for creation and submission of papers and presentation files for FEMTC 2016.  This system should make editing, reviewing and publishing of your work quick and easy.

Please watch the YouTube video (~20 min) below, for an overview of the Madoko and GitHub tools that you will be using for your paper.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1HYxi5RCO4 (Watch in HD and full screen for clarity)

You will need to create a free GitHub account if you do not already have one.  https://github.com/join 

Once you have your account username, please email it to conference@thunderheadeng.com so that you can be invited to the femtc2016 project authoring team.

Make sure to work on the files in **YOUR** folder in the GitHub project.
Your folder name will be the last name of the presenter.  You might have more than one document and presentation folder within your presenter folder if more than one paper was accepted.

The same Madoko file format will be used for your presentation too, as shown in the video. The only limitation that we impose is that you do not make your company, product, organization logos too large and obvious. Placing them on the title slide and the last slide is great, inside the presentation, please focus on content.

**Important**: We need your paper and presentation final draft commits in the system by October 15th, 2016.

## Some tips for presentation format.
* The native resolution of the projector will be 1024 x 768, this should help guide the size of the images that are used in your presentation.
* We like images and videos more than lines of text and bullets.  We find it more interesting to augment your talk with graphic slides and not to just read what you are saying from the screen. We can read faster than you can talk. :)
* Enjoy yourself, inform and entertain.
